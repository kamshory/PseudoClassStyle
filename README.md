# PseudoClassStyle
Sometime we need to change pseudo class ::before and ::after style dynamicaly from script but it is not simple way to do it. Now we can use this script to change pseudo class ::before and ::after style using jQuery. It is work in Firefox 50.

In this script, I create 3 stylesheets to show you how does it works. Wherever we initialize the pseudo class style, it will modify style on last stylesheet.
